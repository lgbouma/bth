A naive astronomer, who has never heard of binaries, wants to measure the
occurrence of planets of a certain type around single stars of a certain type.
He performs a S/N-limited transit survey and detects M transit signals that
appear to be from planets of the desired type.  He calculates the number of
stars N that appear to be searchable for the desired type of planet.  He
concludes:

eta(apparent) = M/N

There are many potential pitfalls.  Some genuine transit signals can be missed
by the detection pipeline.  Some apparent transit signals are spurious, from
noise fluctuations, failures of 'detrending', or instrumental effects.  Stars
and planets can be misclassified due to statistical and systematic errors in
the measurements of their properties.  Poor angular resolution causes false
positives due to blends with background eclipsing binaries.  etc., etc.

Here we focus on the problems arising from the fact that stars of the desired
type often exist in binaries (visual or gravitationally bound).

  LB: grav bound vs visual distinction

1. Some of the apparently-searchable stars are really two searchable stars of
the desired type.

2. Some of the apparently-searchable stars are binaries in which one or both
stars are of the desired type but

   (a) The signal of a planet of the desired type would be undetectable because
of the constant light from the other star.

   (b) The signal of a planet of the desired type would be detectable but would
be misclassified because of a combination of the constant light from the other
star, as well as the misestimated host star radius.

  LB: the misestimated stellar radius matters too (e.g., Furlan+ 2017).

3. Some of the detected signals are from planets that are larger than the
desired type, due to the reduction in signal amplitude from the light of a
second star.

  LB: right. We can only deal w/ this w/ numerical integration (TBD). 

4. Planets of the desired type have a different occurrence rate in the presence
of a secondary star (due to dynamical stability or some aspect of planet
formation).

5. Some of the apparently-searchable stars are binaries in which neither star
is of the desired type.  Their combined light somehow made them resemble a
single star of the desired type.  We will not consider errors of this type.  We
will assume that all the apparently-searchable stars are either single stars of
the desired type, or binaries in which the primary is of the desired type.

Our approach is step-by-step starting from a very simple scenario.

- We consider a universe consisting of only the desired types of stars and
  planets.  We give analytic expressions for eta(apparent)/eta(true) taking
  into account errors of type 1 and 2.

- We allow for a power-law distribution in the luminosity ratio, dn/dL \propto
  L^\beta.  We assume the secondary is not of the desired stellar type.  We
  give analytic expressions for eta(apparent)/eta(true) taking into account
  errors of type 2.

  LB: this keeps things tractable for the analytics. Do you think empirical
  L(M) is worth holding on to though?

- We allow for a nonzero tolerance dr in the planet radius, and tolerance dL in
  stellar luminosity, to qualify as "desirable".  We recalculate
  eta(apparent)/eta(true) for errors of type 1 and 2.

  LB: I think this has to become numerical to actually evaluate the occurrence
  rate correction factor, X_Gamma.

- We assume the planets have a power-law radius distribution, d\eta/dr \propto
  r^\alpha.  We calculate the apparent d\eta/dr taking into account errors of
  type 1-3.  We do so for stars of the desired type within some tolerance dL.

  LB: this one needs numerics to evaluate the integrals if you assume it's a
  _truncated_ power law. TBD.

- We could try to compute the apparent d\eta/dr for planets regardless of host
  star, but this might be more complicated than it is worth, because of the
  differences in transit probabilities.

- Everything up to now is more-or-less analytic, perhaps supported by numerical
  checking or numerical integration. ((At the end we focus specifically on
  eta-Earth and Kepler)).  We simulate a sample of 20,000
  apparently-searchable-stars (or however many "stars" appear to be searchable
  for Earthlike planets in the Kepler field).  Basically this means a magnitude
  limited survey of 20,000 "stars" that are either single or are binaries with
  the primary of the desired type.  The sample has a realistic distribution of
  binaries (occurrence and luminosity ratio).  We calculate
  eta(apparent)/eta(true).  We can also play with errors of type 4 in this
  numerical model.  (It is probably not worth doing so for the analytic work.)

LB:
* You're probably correct about type 4 errors (intrinsic astrophysical
  differences). The way to play with this is just present both limits, and then
  also present a few weight factors (Furlan+17 do a good job).
* I am not convinced that eta-Earth is worth focusing on.
  It is the most complicated case, because the completeness of the pipelines is
  a HIGHLY uncertain factor.
  I think we can mention it (e.g. as Furlan+ 2017 do, in passing, at the end).
  But I think a more general approach is clearer.
  "accounting only for dilution & its numerator effect, big radius planets have
  underestimated inferred rates, the smallest radius planets have overestimated
  inferred rates, and the in-between radius planets are in-between"
  We could then dig in a bit to what happens with different assumed
  completeness vs Rp functions...
* I think more notable could be the claimed HJ occ rate discrepency btwn RV &
  transit surveys.
  This is b/c the more believable occ rate papers do not heavily rely on their
  completeness calibration -- they know they're complete.
  This is also a much more understandable regime.
* Maybe more notable would also be "how do we interpret Fulton+ 2017?"
  That paper did (or claims to have done) a good job at weeding out numerator
  errors. If true, means Î“(Rp) has the right shape, and just the wrong
  normalization. Important if we ever manage to convince ourselves "brightest
  transit hosts" could work.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS W/ THE NUMERICAL MODEL-
* currently have not implemented self-consistent (L,M,R) relation between
  primaries and secondaries.
  Wang et al (2015) avoided that problem by doing a similar empirical thing to
  what I currently have implemented. But I do not think that was a good paper.
  Ciardi et al (2015) have an approach that was Kepler-specific -- they used
  the same Dartmouth isochrones used for KIC stellar parameters.
  But they did not conserve dn/dm_x, for m_x apparent mag in band x.
  I think the latter choice might be better for Kepler-specific discussion.
  But it's less-nice if we want this to be general enough for e.g., occ HJ
  rates w/ TESS.

  My main gripe w/ taking the 150k KIC stars & adding binaries is that less
  is known about those parameters and biases. Using e.g., Galaxia has the major
  benefit of you understand what's been cooked in much better (it's minimal).
  
  I think if we want to talk about Kepler, it's the best possible approach
  though.

  If we want to talk about Fulton+17 we can go further, and apply the CKS cuts.

  
Some questions based on the current draft:

- Why should we ever consider F_lim < F_min?

LB: in practice, surveys look at many stars for which they could not detect
Rp=Re planets, but could detect Rp=10Re planets.  One possible error is
miscounting which stars are which (i.e. getting completeness corrections
wrong). So this was more for plausbility than b/c it's immediately needed in
the analytics. I can cut it.

- Why do we need to consider the distribution of S/N, as opposed to simply the
  limiting distance for detection?

LB: for "model 1" (fixed stars, fixed planets, fixed light ratio binaries)
you're correct, it's not immediately necessary. 

For this model, I did it as a way to think through the completeness effects
systematically -- i.e. how for the twin-binary case, you get a completeness
fraction of 1/8, though your limiting distance is sqrt(2) times bigger. (Even
when your completeness for the singles is 100%).

If we go the path of completing "model 2"'s analytics (vary light ratio, fixed
primary luminosity, fixed planet), I think this formulation would become
necessary in order to actually evaluate the completeness fractions.

(I never completed these analytics b/c of the L(M) mess + confusion about
assumed stellar masses+radii. Power law L(M) helps this... I think there needs
to be an extra assumption about the stellar mass+radius change though that we
have not spelled out)

- I don't think the bandpass, effective area, photon count rate, etc.  are
  needed, either. All that matters is the limiting distance.

Are needed for what? 
In Model 1, for analytic expressions of the occurrence rate, I agree.
For analytic expressions of the number of detected planets, I disagree.

For Model 2, I'm not sure because I got bogged down. I suspect that for
occurrence rate errors, you are correct. 

The analytic expression I gave for the occurrence rate depends on this "xi"
factor, which needs to incorporate an assumption about how Astronomer A
misestimates the completeness (relatedly, how he misestimates Rstar).  I never
specified that assumption.


- In Eq. 4, is this a traditional definition of BF?  I would have defined it as
  nd/(ns+nd) or perhaps 2*nd/(ns+ 2*nd).  Let's make sure we are using
  traditional terminology, and also interpreting the literature correctly, i.e.,
  is the right number really 0.45?

Oops. nd/(ns+nd) = BF = MF (if assuming all multiple systems are binaries).
This minor change propagates.

Touching up on correct terminology, from Duchene & Kraus 2013, Sec 2.1:

"Frequency of multiple systems" (MF)
vs
"Companion frequency" (CF; average # of companions per target, can exceed 100%)

my understanding of the terms:

survey 1: {*, **, *, ***, *, *}

6 systems.
2 are multiple.
MF = 2/6 = 1/3
CF = (0+1+0+2+0+0)/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

survey 2: {**, **, ***, ****, *}

5 systems
4 are multiple
MF = 4/5
CF = (1+1+2+3+0)/5 = 6/5

DK2013 Sec 3.1.1 give (citing Raghavan+ 2010)
MF^{MS}_{1-1.3Msun} = 50 \pm 4%
MF^{MS}_{0.7-1Msun} = 41 \pm 3%

They also give
CF^{MS}_{1-1.3Msun} = 75 \pm 5%
CF^{MS}_{0.7-1Msun} = 56 \pm 4%

I understand the first pair of numbers to mean:

In a volume-limited survey (of the stellar neighborhood), if you select systems
for which the primary is from 1-1.3Msun, 50% of them will be multiple.

I take the second pair of numbers to mean:

In a volume-limited survey (of the stellar neighborhood), if you select systems
for which the primary is from 1-1.3Msun, each system will on average have 0.75
companions.




Have a think, & edit my outline if you wish.  Did I miss any interesting types
of errors?  Are the proposed calculations logical and well-posed or are there
subtleties that will make things murky?  And then feel free to drop by to
discuss furtherâ€¦.
