For Kepler downloads:

Can get DR25 stellar parameter posteriors alluded to by KM from
https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/bulk_data_download/, the "Stellar
Replicated Posteriors".

Started this wget download, but it's 800Gb and more info than I care for.

Better, from http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kic.html can download an ASCII
version of the KIC. Done

From http://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/catalogs/README, we are looking at 

kic.txt.gz:
A 13.1 million row "|"-delimited gzipped ASCII file containing the complete
Kepler Input Catalog (version 10).  

From this, follow Sharma+ 2016 ApJ 822:15 approach to comparing the catalogs.
Compare distributions for <7.5deg from center of Kepler field, and magnitude
<14.

(b/c KIC is complete to magnitudes fainter than 14 mag in r).
